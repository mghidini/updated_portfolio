      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>VIVI is a project born in Elisava Barcelona, by students from the Human Interaction and AI Master. It's a 3-month collaborative AI product design sprint, focused on building an emotionally intelligent chatbot to help people grow and nurture their relationships. </p>

      <h2>What is VIVI?</h2>
      <p>Vivi is a mobile app that logs relationships and how they affect our mental health, while an AI powered chatbot offers support and guidance to help make our relationships last longer and be nurtured in the healthiest way. 
It was created from the standpoint that AI shouldn’t be used to push people further away form each other as humans, but rather help us come closer together.</p>
      <p>Love, at the end of the day, it’s what we do best and what could never be replaced.</p>

      <h2>The team</h2>
      <p>VIVI's an idea born by seriously caring people trying to use technology for good: Andrés Nieto Noi, Cisem Melike Sahpaz, Sol Ruiz Bastida and Matilde Ghidini.
Students of the Master in Human Interaction and AI at ELISAVA, we all share a passion for technology and human-centred design, while using our strengths to make this project come to life.
Çisem, with her background in architecture and interior design directed the research and creative
prototype part that we did with several academic resources and Figma.
Andres, with his background in graphic design and interaction design worked on the design and
visual architectures of the prototype, video creation and user flows.
Sol, with her background in fashion and communications focused on storytelling and developing
the red thread that connect our mission to our reality, as well as working on wire framing.
With my background in computer science and engineering I fuelled the coding part by
working on Javascript, , HTML, CSS and Python to develop the webpage that was then
integrated with the OpenAI GPT model.</p>

        <p>Vivi shows up with a calming UI, a caring introduction, and an initial questionnaire about you and your daily life.
Future responses from Vivi reinforces the safety feeling and encourages me to open up more, forming a positive loop.</p>

        <p>The fact that Vivi begins our chat by asking questions about my casual life not only builds a warm and curious vibe, but also sets a chitchatting tone for the conversation.</p>
        <p>The power behind Vivi relies on the fact that it knows you, it understand the data of how you behave to help you as deeply as possible without you constantly having to explain yourself.
This is why VIVI requires access to your information and data.
VIVI examines your screen time, dating apps behaviours, camera and messages to truly understand how you feel.</p>
        <img src="/images/placeholder2.jpg" alt="Process step" />
        <p>Privacy is one of the biggest commitments. You choose how much you want to  share, and how you share it. You’re always in control.</p>
        <img src="/images/placeholder2.jpg" alt="Process step" />
        <p>For this reason, the app encourages you to build your constellation of relationships and continuously helps you to grow and nurture them, through a personalised chatbot, daily challenges and check-ins.</p>
