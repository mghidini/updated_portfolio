        <p>This project was part of the Elisava School of Design and Engineering's Interdisciplinary Workshop on extinction practices and archiving humanity’s traces, led by Self Segato from Domestic Data Streamers.</p>
        <p>We transformed into teams of researchers, with the objective to create a Museum of Future Identity, each installation pushing the boundaries of imagination and critical thought.</p>
        <p>Me and my team, as digital archaeologists, we worked intensely to collect, analyse, and reconstruct traces of humanity, making sense of what might be left behind in a post-human world.</p>

      <h2>The process</h2>
        <p>We started by selecting physical objects, daily life items that could represent us as individuals and humans.
            The then took pictures of these object and start experimenting with AI Image tools like Midjourney and Krea.
            We used prompting and merging to manipulate those pictures, imagining and visualizing how these artifacts would look as fossils in a post-human future.
            The result was a technofossil archive and we decided to give this archive the form of a website.</p>

      <h2>The exhibition</h2>
      <p>Our technofossil archive became part of the Museum of Future Identity, an exhibition that was held and curated by the students of the workshop.
        In our interactive exhibition, the technofossil website was open for visitors to navigate, while the original objects were set on the table aside.
        The combination between real objects and AI generated fossils created an immersive experience, pushing the boundaries between human and machines, past and future, existence and extinction.</p>

      <p>It was a reminder that design is not just about creating, it’s about understanding, preserving, and questioning.</p>
